- Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy but required the longest training time.
- Decision Tree and MLP offered a good trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.
- kNN had fast training but slower prediction time, making it unsuitable for real-time systems.
- Logistic Regression was fastest overall but less accurate, making it suitable for lightweight applications.

Methodology

1. Dataset Preprocessing  
   - Feature selection  
   - Data cleaning and encoding  
   - Train-test split  

2. Model Training & Evaluation

3. Comparison & Analysis  
   - Identify best-performing models considering both detection performance and computational efficiency.


Conclusion

The study revealed that while Random Forest provides superior accuracy and balanced performance,
 it is computationally expensive. Decision Tree and MLP are recommended alternatives for scenarios where computational
 resources are limited or where real-time performance is necessary.
 The study also highlights the importance of balancing accuracy with system efficiency in intrusion detection systems.
